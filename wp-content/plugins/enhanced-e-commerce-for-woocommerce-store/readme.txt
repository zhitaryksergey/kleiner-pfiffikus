== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=  What is google shopping and how does it work? =

Google Shopping helps sellers make their shops and products available for millions of users across Google.Google Shopping is a new product discovery experience. The goal is to make it easy for users to research purchases, find information about different products, their features and prices, and then connect with sellers to make their purchase. Google Shopping enables users to view product information from the sellers that is updated on a regular basis by sellers. Online retailers submit feeds containing product information to Google Shopping. Since this product information comes directly from the seller, this means we’re able to show the current prices, latest offers and current product availability. Hence, Google Shopping helps eCommerce businesses find more customers to their websites.

= How do sellers enroll for Google Shopping? =

Create Merchant Center Account: Once you have an account open, verify important details like your business and contact information.

Below are the steps to unclaim and reclaim domain(via plugin) in GMC:

<b>Unclaim the domain:</b>

= Can I use the plugin only for Google Analytics4 tracking? =

"Yes, you can use the plugin for Google Analytics4 tracking. However, we suggest to enable the tracking for UA and GA4, both as Google recommends to use the Universal Analytics inorder to be sure about the tracked data in GA4. Further, you can monitor the data in Universal Analytics & Google Analytics4 and when you are sure about the correct data collection in GA4 then you can completely migrate."

= How can I create Universal Analytics(Google Analytics3) property id in new Google Analytics account? =

Navigate to <a href="https://prnt.sc/vy4j1i">Admin -> Create Property -> click 'Show advanced options</a> in your Google Analytics account and create a new UA- property id under the Advanced Options.

= Where can I find the setting for this plugin? =

Once the plugin is activated, the <a href="https://prnt.sc/10jpyh6">Settings option</a> can be found under the plugin - "Enhanced E-commerce for Woocommerce store" listed in the installed plugins.

= Do I Need to add any custom code for it? =

No, as our plugin automatically inserts the GA tracking code and tracks all the Enhanced Ecommerce data on your store. So, you don’t need to add any custom/manual code to track Ecommerce events.

= Does this plugin match with GDPR compliance? =

Yes, our plugin is under GDPR compliance. For more information, read the <a href="https://www.tatvic.com/privacy-policy/?ref=plugin_policy&utm_source=plugin_backend&utm_medium=woocommerce_free_plugin&utm_campaign=GDPR_complaince_ecomm_plugins" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> of our plugin.

= Why are my PayPal transaction data not getting recorded in GA? =

If you are facing this issue, please check if you have configured auto return in PayPal settings.  Configuring auto return will resolve your issue. Here’s a PayPal <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/mer/express_return_summary-outside" target="_blank">documentation</a> & WooCommerce <a href="http://docs.woothemes.com/document/paypal-standard/#section-5" target="_blank">documentation</a> on understanding & setting up Auto Return.

In case you have already configured auto return for your store and facing the issue then you could <a href="https://conversios.io/?utm_source=EE+Plugin+WordPress+Listing&utm_medium=PayPal+transaction+FAQ&utm_campaign=Raise+query+at+Conversios#wpforms-form-11056">reach out to us</a>

= I’ve install the plugin but I do not see any data in my GA =

"Following are one or more reasons: 

(1) You need to make sure that you have enabled Enhanced Ecommerce setting in your GA Account. If you have not enabled then follow the below steps:

-> Go to Admin section of your Google Analytics Account
-> In the view section, click on Ecommerce Settings
-> Switch on the Enhanced Ecommerce Settings button


Note: If you do not see the above setting, it means that you are still on the waiting list and you may have to wait till Google rolls out this for your web property

(2) If the Enhanced Ecommerce setting is enabled in your GA and you have just installed our plugin, then please wait for at-least 24 hours before you start seeing any data in your GA. If you still face this issue after 24 hours, please <a href="https://conversios.io/?utm_source=EE+Plugin+WordPress+Listing&utm_medium=do+not+see+any+data+in+my+GA+FAQ&utm_campaign=Raise+query+at+Conversios#wpforms-form-11056">reach out to us</a>."

= Does your plugin supports new Global Site Tag (gtag.js)? =

Yes our plugin supports the new Global Site Tag (gtag.js).

= Since I have Implemented Old GA Script (UA Script) Manually in my store, I didn't enable Add Global site Tracking Code option gtag.js, but seems that it is not working. =

"When you have the UA script/tag implemented via your GTM, it may happen sometimes that the script might take/make any delay in loading on your store and due to which our plugin may not work well on your store.

Reason :

Our Plugin’s script works/fetches the data based on the GTAG’s default tracker (‘gtag’ in the case of Universal Analytics script used in our plugin). While you implement the UA tracking script from your GTM, the script in your store may not be able to initialize the tracker, which in turn will hinder the plugin from populating insights in your Analytics account."

= Where I can see my all Enhanced Ecommerce Reports (Eg. Sales Report,Product Performance Report)? =

You can find all the Enhanced Ecommerce Reports in your Analytics Account under the Reports -> Conversions –> Ecommerce section.

= Products with variant not getting recorded in GA =

Currently our plugin does not support products with variants & hence you may not see their transaction data in GA. This feature is only available with the <a href="https://conversios.io/pricings/?utm_source=EE+Plugin+WordPress+Listing&utm_medium=Products+with+variant+FAQ&utm_campaign=Upsell+at+Conversios" target="_blank">premium version</a> of our plugin.

= Does this plugin provide Google Ads Conversion Tracking? =

The free version of our plugin does not provide Google Ads Conversion Tracking feature. This feature is only available with the <a href="https://conversios.io/pricings/?utm_source=EE+Plugin+WordPress+Listing&utm_medium=Google+Ads+Conversion+Tracking+FAQ&utm_campaign=Upsell+at+Conversios" target="_blank">premium version</a> of our plugin.

= Why some transactions are missing in my GA account, compared to my WooCommerce backend (Orders) =

Possible reasons for not getting the accurate Transactions (in sales performance report of GA) are as below :

- If a user completes the transaction via a 3rd party payment gateway and is not redirected back to your store’s thank you page.

- If the thankyou page URL structure is not as per the standard WooCommerce implementation. The standard thankyou page URL structure should be like: www.domain.name/checkout/order-received/99999/?key=wc_order_XXXXXXXXXXXXX

- If any javascript error is detected on the “thank you” page of your store which may restrict plugin’s code to get executed further.

- Some browsers and common ad blocking programs block certain JavaScripts
(including GA’s script), which means Google Analytics is unable to record transactions.

- The user has left the page before the transaction has had a chance to send to Google Analytics.

Additionally, GA is a trend analysis tool, and as such cannot be expected to be 100% accurate. However, if the variance is greater than 10-12%, there might be an issue with the coding!"

= Why my Ecommerce transaction data are not getting recorded in GA? =

User needs to check if you have auto return configured in your payment gateway settings. If a user completes the transaction via a 3rd party payment gateway and is not redirected back to your store’s thank you page, our plugin will not be able to send the order transaction data. Hence, this may result into missing order transaction data in your GA. You can resolve this issue by configuring auto return in your payment gateway settings.

= Does this plugin help me create/configure goals/funnels in my GA account? =

Configuring goals are out of the scope of our plugin. Our plugin is designed to track checkout funnels only.

= Does your plugin support a Multilingual Wordpress site? =

Our plugin supports a Multilingual Wordpress site.

= Does your plugin supports Child/Custom Theme? =

The free version of our plugin is not fully compatible with the child/custom theme. Request you to go through the <a href="https://conversios.io/pricings/?utm_source=EE+Plugin+WordPress+Listing&utm_medium=Child%2FCustom+Theme+FAQ&utm_campaign=Upsell+at+Conversios" target="_blank">premium version</a> of our plugin which is fully compatible with the child/custom theme. We are not providing any kind of support for Child/Custom Theme in the Free version of our plugin. For more information kindly contact us at info(at)conversios(dot)io.

= Does Tatvic provide full support for the free version plugin? =

We have a limited support policy for the free version of our plugin. Kindly go through the <a href="https://conversios.io/pricings/?utm_source=EE+Plugin+WordPress+Listing&utm_medium=full+support+for+the+free+version+FAQ&utm_campaign=Upsell+at+Conversios" target="_blank">premium version</a> of our plugin to get full support for the product or you can also contact us at info(at)conversios(dot)io.

= How to verify if I have implemented the plugin well? =

User can install and activate the dataslayer extension available for Chrome(<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dataslayer/ikbablmmjldhamhcldjjigniffkkjgpo">link</a>) and Firefox(<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dataslayer-firefox/">link</a>) browsers and can see the tracked data under a new 'dataslayer' tab that appears in the Developer tools. Here is the <a href="https://prnt.sc/10jqc64">screenshot link</a> for reference.

= How much time will it take to see the data in Google Analytics? =

It generally depends upon the store traffic. But in general it may take max up to 24 hours & min 4 hours to see the data in Google Analytics.

= Why does the plugin not send data when I am logged in as an Admin? =

To avoid sending your own transaction data or session data in Google Analytics, our plugin doesn't send the data to GA when you are logged in. Having said that, if you are logged in as a Shop Manager, plugin will send the data to GA.

= The tracking via the plugin doesn't work as I am getting 'gtag.js not defined' error in the console? =

The error occurs because the gtag snippet for GA tracking snippet is missing on the store.

And the most probable cause it is the option “Add Global Site Tracking Code ‘gtag.js' under the configuration settings of the plugin is unchecked.You need to check this option to resolve the error and the tracking via the plugin would start working.

= Can I use my own GTM with this plugin? =

User can use his own GTM, provided the data which the plugin tracks should not be tracked by the custom tags and triggers and if such tags and triggers are their then please remove them to prevent the data duplication issue.

= Why some eCommerce steps(like Add_To_Cart, Product_View etc.) on my store are not getting tracked? =

The following are general reason due to which the tracking may not be working at some eCommerce steps: 

* If the eCommerce steps do not follow the standard WooCommerce implmentation and were implemented via a custom child theme. Our plugin works completely when all the eCommerce steps in a store follow the standard WooCommerce implementation.

* If there is/are of jQuery error(s) in the console. Occurance of jQuery error blocks the loading of GA tracking snippet via the plugin.

* If there is js minification implemented using a cache plugin. The js minification blocks the loading of GA tracking snippet via the plugin.

= Why some or all data are getting duplicated on my store? =

There could be duplicate tracking via manually implemented GA tracking snippet and/or other GA tracking plugin and/or GTM implementation. 

You can resolve the duplication of data by removing the manually implemented GA tracking snippet and/or other GA tracking plugin. The duplication of tracking via GTM can be resolved by removing the custom tags and triggers which track the duplicate data
