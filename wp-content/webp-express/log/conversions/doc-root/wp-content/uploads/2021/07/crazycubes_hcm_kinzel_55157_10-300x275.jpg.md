Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: *Exec failed* (the cwebp binary was not found at path: cwebp, or it had missing library dependencies)
Nope a plain cwebp call does not work (spent 3 ms)
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries (spent 8 ms)
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 0 binaries (spent 16 ms)
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Linux)... We do. We in fact have 4
