Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)

Nope a plain cwebp call does not work (spent 4 ms)
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries (spent 11 ms)
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
